#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software and the importances of software engineering are:
Reliability -it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.mastering complexity:   -This period was characterized by a focus on optimizing software to the limitations of early hardware.
                        - The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL. These languages moved software development away from machine-specific code, making it more accessible.
                         -This period also included the early development of compilers.
Mastering process:        -As software projects grew in complexity, the need for structured development processes became apparent.
                         -The rise of structured programming and the waterfall model. These methodologies introduced systematic approaches to software development, emphasizing planning and organization.
                         -Also the beginning of the software crisis, that helped to bring about the term and the profession of software engineering.
Mastering machine:       -The growth of cloud computing and AI. Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure, while AI is increasingly used to automate tasks and improve software development processes.
                        -This current era is about dealing with the massive scale of modern software
                        -The rise of Agile methodologies and DevOps practices. These approaches emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and continuous delivery, enabling teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver software more quickly.
                        
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
                       - there is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
                       - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
                       - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
                  - High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
                  -Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
                  - Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
                   - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
                   - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
 Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
                            - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
                            - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
 Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
                 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
                 - create blueprint for the project.
                 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.                           
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
{IDE }:  is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
  - Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
  - an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
(VCS) :  are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration - Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking - Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
Branching and Merging - Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement- places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
         [Solution]: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
-Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
         [Solution]: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
         [Solution]: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
-Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
           - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
                   - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
                -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
                 - Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.Importance:
   - Improved user experience -It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data
   -Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
   -developer control - Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Write something about animals."
Why this is vague:It's incredibly broad. "Animals" encompasses everything from microscopic organisms to whales.
"Write something" is undefined. Is it a story? A poem? A factual report?
There's no indication of the desired length, tone, or target audience.
               -Improved Prompt:"Create a short (200-word) informative paragraph about the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies, targeted at a middle school audience."
Why this is improved:
               -Clear: It specifies the exact animal (monarch butterflies).    
               -Specific: It defines the topic (migratory patterns), the format (paragraph), the length (200 words), and the target audience (middle school).
               -Concise: It delivers all the necessary information efficiently.
Why the improved prompt is more effective:
           -Focused Output: The improved prompt directs the AI to produce a very specific type of content, reducing the chance of irrelevant or unusable results.
           -Efficient Processing: By providing clear parameters, the AI can process the request more efficiently, saving time and resources.
           -Predictable Results: The user has a much better idea of what to expect, leading to higher satisfaction.
           -Reduces Ambiguity: when a prompt is vague, the AI has to make assumptions, which can lead to results that the user did not want.
